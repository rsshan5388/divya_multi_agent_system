    "question": "51. In machine learning, which regularization technique adds the absolute value of coefficients as a penalty term to the loss function?",
    "options": [
        "Ridge Regression",
        "Lasso Regression",
        "Elastic Net",
        "Dropout"
    ],
    "answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Lasso Regression (L1 regularization) adds the absolute value of coefficients as penalty, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, thus performing feature selection.",
    "correct_answer": "Lasso Regression",
