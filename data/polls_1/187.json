    "question": "28. If a link transmits 4000 frames per second, and each slot has 8 bits, what is the transmission rate of the circuit using Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)?",
    "options": [
        "500kbps",
        "32kbps",
        "32bps",
        "500bps"
    ],
    "answer": "Answer: b\nExplanation: Transmission rate= frame rate * number of bits in a slot.\nGiven: Frame rate = 4000/sec and number of bits in slot = 8\nThus, Transmission rate = (4000 * 8) bps\n= 32000bps\n= 32kbps",
    "correct_answer": "32kbps",
