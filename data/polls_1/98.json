    "question": "10. How is a single channel shared by multiple signals in a computer network?",
    "options": [
        "multiplexing",
        "phase modulation",
        "analog modulation",
        "digital modulation"
    ],
    "answer": "Answer: a\nExplanation: In communication and computer networks, the main goal is to share a scarce resource. This is done by multiplexing, where multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium. The multiple kinds of signals are designated by the transport layer which is the layer present on a higher level than the physical layer.",
