    "question": "Imagine a user asks a large language model about the planet with the most moons. How does the RAG framework improve the accuracy of the response?",
    "options": [
        "By relying solely on the pre-trained knowledge of the LLM",
        "By increasing the confidence level of the LLM's responses",
        "By using a different LLM trained on astronomical data",
        "By instructing the model to consult the content store before generating a response"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "By instructing the model to consult the content store before generating a response",
    "explanation": "The RAG framework improves accuracy by allowing the model to access external content, ensuring responses are based on the most relevant and up-to-date information.",
