    "question": "Which of the following best describes the main purpose of using data models (like Pydantic classes) in a Reflexion-based agent?",
    "options": [
        "They enable the agent to self-modify its architecture by generating new neural weights.",
        "They automatically replace the need for reflection or self-critique by embedding logic in the LLM itself.",
        "They allow the agent to directly control hardware resources like memory and processing power.",
        "They enforce a predictable structure for the agent’s outputs, ensuring components like answers, critiques, and search queries follow a consistent format."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "They enforce a predictable structure for the agent’s outputs, ensuring components like answers, critiques, and search queries follow a consistent format.",
    "explanation": "Data models like Pydantic classes are used to ensure that the outputs of the agent are structured consistently, which is crucial for maintaining reliable communication and processing.",
