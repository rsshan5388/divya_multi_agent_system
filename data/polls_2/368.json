    "question": "What is the purpose of the hierarchical structure in the HNSW algorithm?",
    "options": [
        "It allows the algorithm to skip the need for greedy routing by using random walks.",
        "It enables fast and scalable search by combining long-range and short-range connections across layers.",
        "It ensures that all data points are stored only in the topmost layer to reduce memory usage.",
        "It guarantees exact nearest neighbor results by using brute-force search at each level."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "It enables fast and scalable search by combining long-range and short-range connections across layers.",
    "explanation": "The hierarchical structure in HNSW allows for efficient search by leveraging both long-range and short-range connections, improving scalability and speed.",
