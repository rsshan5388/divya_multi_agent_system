    "question": "What makes the HNSW algorithm efficient for approximate nearest neighbor search in large datasets?",
    "options": [
        "Its hierarchical structure enables fast traversal from coarse to fine layers, reducing the number of distance computations.",
        "It compresses vectors to reduce dimensionality before indexing.",
        "It stores all data points only in the topmost layer to minimize memory usage.",
        "It uses brute-force search at each layer to guarantee accuracy."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Its hierarchical structure enables fast traversal from coarse to fine layers, reducing the number of distance computations.",
    "explanation": "The HNSW algorithm uses a hierarchical structure that allows for efficient traversal and reduces the number of distance computations needed, making it suitable for large datasets.",
