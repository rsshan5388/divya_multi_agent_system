    "question": "How do vector databases enhance recommendation systems compared to traditional databases?",
    "options": [
        "By using vector embeddings to capture semantic similarities between data points.",
        "By organizing data into tables for better indexing and search performance.",
        "By relying solely on user input to generate recommendations.",
        "By storing data in a structured format that allows fast retrieval of exact matches."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "By using vector embeddings to capture semantic similarities between data points.",
    "explanation": "Vector databases use embeddings to understand and compare data points based on their semantic meaning, which enhances recommendation systems by identifying similarities beyond exact matches.",
