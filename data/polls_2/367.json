    "question": "What are the key differences between locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) indexing in FAISS?",
    "options": [
        "Both LSH and HNSW are used for exact search in FAISS.",
        "HNSW is used for exact search, whereas LSH is for distributed data storage.",
        "LSH is used for approximate nearest neighbor search using hash buckets, whereas HNSW is a graph-based index that organizes vectors hierarchically for efficient search.",
        "LSH provides exact search results, whereas HNSW is used for hashing vectors."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "LSH is used for approximate nearest neighbor search using hash buckets, whereas HNSW is a graph-based index that organizes vectors hierarchically for efficient search.",
    "explanation": "LSH and HNSW serve different purposes in FAISS. LSH is used for approximate nearest neighbor search, while HNSW organizes vectors hierarchically for efficient search.",
