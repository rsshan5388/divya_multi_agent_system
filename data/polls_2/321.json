    "question": "In the context of RAG, how does LlamaIndex handle the embedding and storing of vectors compared to LangChain?",
    "options": [
        "LlamaIndex uses a single command to generate and store vectors, whereas LangChain does these actions separately.",
        "LangChain and LlamaIndex both use a single command to generate and store vectors.",
        "LlamaIndex generates and stores vectors separately, similar to LangChain.",
        "Both frameworks require manual setup for embedding vector metadata."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "LlamaIndex uses a single command to generate and store vectors, whereas LangChain does these actions separately.",
    "explanation": "LlamaIndex simplifies the process by combining vector generation and storage into a single command, unlike LangChain which separates these actions.",
