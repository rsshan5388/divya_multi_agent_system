    "question": "Layla is building an AI application that needs to access proprietary company information not present in her LLM's training data. She's deciding between implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or fine-tuning the model. Which statement correctly describes the difference between these approaches?",
    "options": [
        "Fine-tuning is cheaper than RAG because it requires less computational resources at query time",
        "RAG modifies the model's weights to incorporate new information, while fine-tuning passes relevant documents with each query",
        "Fine-tuning is ideal for frequently changing information, while RAG works best with static knowledge bases",
        "RAG retrieves relevant information at query time and includes that information in the prompt, while fine-tuning updates the model's internal knowledge so it can provide domain specific answers every time."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "RAG retrieves relevant information at query time and includes that information in the prompt, while fine-tuning updates the model's internal knowledge so it can provide domain specific answers every time.",
    "explanation": "RAG dynamically retrieves information at query time, making it suitable for accessing external data. Fine-tuning involves updating the model's internal parameters to incorporate new knowledge.",
