    "question": "A developer team at MedScope AI tries to use MM-RAG-style retrieval to pull user data based on file names. Why is this approach flawed?",
    "options": [
        "File names contain hidden metadata that retrieval models rely on",
        "File names are converted to vectors using ResNet",
        "The file names must be matched exactly to produce results",
        "Retrieval should be based on semantic similarity between embeddings, not file names"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Retrieval should be based on semantic similarity between embeddings, not file names",
    "explanation": "MM-RAG-style retrieval relies on semantic similarity rather than exact matches of file names. Using file names directly does not leverage the model's ability to understand content meaning.",
