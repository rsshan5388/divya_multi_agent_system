    "question": "Why is LangGraph a better fit for this use case compared to traditional constructs?",
    "options": [
        "Because LangGraph enables state persistence, dynamic branching, and human-in-the-loop interaction",
        "Because LangGraph visualizes loops more effectively than for-loops in Python",
        "Because LangGraph uses fewer resources than while loops",
        "Because LangGraph offers built-in machine learning capabilities"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Because LangGraph enables state persistence, dynamic branching, and human-in-the-loop interaction",
    "explanation": "LangGraph is better suited for applications requiring state persistence and adaptability, which traditional constructs like if statements and loops lack.",
