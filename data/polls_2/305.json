    "question": "Imagine you are developing a chatbot for a company with a complex mobile policy. How does the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) process ensure the chatbot provides accurate and domain-specific responses to questions about the company's mobile policy?",
    "options": [
        "By retraining the language model with the company's mobile policy data to improve its accuracy",
        "By using a pre-trained language model that inherently understands all domain-specific policies",
        "By embedding the company's mobile policy into high-dimensional vectors and using them to retrieve relevant information to generate responses",
        "By creating a rule-based system that manually encodes the company's mobile policy into the chatbot"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "By embedding the company's mobile policy into high-dimensional vectors and using them to retrieve relevant information to generate responses",
    "explanation": "The RAG process involves embedding documents into vectors to retrieve relevant information, which is then used to generate accurate responses.",
